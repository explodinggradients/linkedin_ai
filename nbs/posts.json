I have already contributed to Llama4\u2019s image grounding capabilities.\n\nLlama4 Scout is the best-in-class on image grounding, able to align user prompts with relevant visual concepts and anchor model responses to regions in the image. This enables more precise visual question answering for the LLM to better understand user intent and localize objects of interest. \n\nI am super thrilled that the grounding capabilities got featured as a demo in the Llama blog post (link below)!
