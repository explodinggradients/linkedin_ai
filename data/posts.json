The article talks about my Gibbs Lecture at the meeting.\n\nQuote: << On the second evening, Yann LeCun, the chief A.I. scientist at Meta, gave a keynote lecture titled ‚ÄúMathematical Obstacles on the Way to Human-Level A.I.‚Äù Dr. LeCun got a bit into the technical weeds, but there were digestible tidbits.\n‚ÄúThe current state of machine learning is that it sucks,‚Äù he said during the lecture, to much chortling. ‚ÄúNever mind humans, never mind trying to reproduce mathematicians or scientists; we can‚Äôt even reproduce what a cat can do.‚Äù\n Instead of the generative large language models powering chatbots, he argued, a ‚Äúlarge-scale world model‚Äù would be the better bet for advancing and improving the technology. Such a system, he said in an interview after the lecture, ‚Äúcan reason and plan because it has a mental model of the world that predicts consequences of its action.‚Äù But there are obstacles, he admitted ‚Äî some mathematically intractable problems, their solutions nowhere in sight. >>",

US funds (e.g. at Google-DeepMind in London or Meta-FAIR in Paris).\n\nIan points to a lower tolerance for risk in Europe than in the US, both from entrepreneurs and (perhaps more importantly) from investors. There is that.\n\nBut there is another important factor: almost all of the fundamental innovations in AI of the last dozen years did *not* come from startups. They came from well-funded industry research labs belonging to large and highly-profitable companies: Google, Meta, Microsoft, and a few others. \nDeepMind would *never* have survived, let alone deliver breakthroughs, without being bought by a large company like Google. Their original business model as an independent company was never going to fly, in part because long-term research is expensive, and in part because they were overly optimistic about their time-line to AGI (their original plan for AGI based on RL was a complete failure).\n\nWhy haven't large European group started ambitious AI research labs in the vain of Google Brain, DeepMind, FAIR, or MSR?\nEuropean comapanies used to have world-class research labs, but not anymore. In the heydays of Bell Labs, IBM Research, Xerox PARC, and Microsoft Research, there were such labs Europe in the 1980s (e.g. Phillips Labs, Siemens, France Telecom, Alcatel). But they never valued research scientist careers like American tech companies have re-learned to do it, starting with MSR in the laste 90s.\nEuropean industry research labs became shadows of their former selves. But interestingly, they caused some interesting spin-offs to exist: the most valuable European tech company is ASML, which was created on the remnant of Phillips Labs.\n\nThe existence of ambitious industry research labs has an incredibly positive effect on the R&D and startup ecosystem. I witnessed this effect first-hand with the creation of FAIR-Paris in 2015: it almost single-handedly jump-started the AI startup ecosystem in Paris (which is now the most vibrant in Europe today). \n\nThe existence of FAIR-Paris, and later the Parisian branch of DeepMind sent a message to the young aspiring scientists: you can have a career in AI research in Europe, and outside of academia. It motivated and lot of talented students to pursue graduate studies, to learn how to do research by doing a PhD. \nFAIR-Paris contributed to this by hosting PhD students in residence. FAIR graduates a dozen PhDs in an average year. \nThey have gone on to do wonderful things in the European ecosystem.\n\nSome have founded AI startups and raised large amounts of capital .... but often from US investors.",

I mean, expressing an ambitious vision for the future is great. \nBut telling the public blatantly false prediction (\"AGI next year\", \"1 million robotaxis by 2020\", \"AGI will kill us all, let'spause\",...) is very counterproductive (also illegal in some cases).\n\nMore importantly, I think his public positions on many political issues, journalism, the media and the press, and academia, are not just wrong but dangerous for democracy, civilization, and human wellfare. \nSay what you want about \"traditional media\" but you can't really have reliable information without professional journalists working for a free and diverse press. Democracy can't exist without it, which is why only authoritarian ennemies of democracy rail against the media.\n\nFinally he doesn't seem to hesitate to disseminate batshit-crazy conspiracy theories as long as they serve his interests (e.g. boosting \"PizzaGate\", \"illegal immigrants corrupt elections in the US\", \"person X is a pedo\",...). \nOne would expect a technological visionary to be a rationalist. Rationalism doesn't work without Truth.\n\nThis has become particularly concerning since he bought himself a platform to disseminate his dangerous political opinions, conspiracy theories, and hype.\nHe has been quite na√Øve about the difficulties of running a social network and the (legal) necessity of doing content moderation. One can claim to be a 1st Amendment absolutist, but a lot of content *must* be taken down by law, e.g. terrorist propaganda, child exploitation, blatant hate speech (in the EU and other regions). \nThen, there is dangerous disinformation that puts public health in danger or corrupts the democratic process. You have to moderate that too.\nContent moderation is a complicated problem whose best answer is not an attitude of total laissez-faire but a complex trade-off.",

Conversely, there are lots of good ideas in Chinese publications that make the whole community progress faster.\n\nSecond, AI assistants are fast becoming a kind of compressed repository of all human knowledge.\nIn the near future, every citizen's digital diet will be mediated by AI assistants. \nThis will clearly affect people's knowledge and opinions of history, political dogmas, value systems, etc.\nOnce such AI assistants are available for download and can be run locally, the Great Firewall of China is toast.\nThe control of authoritarian governments over the information received by their citizens will be considerably more difficult to enforce.\nThis makes the Chinese government is even *more* worried about a lack of control of AI technology than their counterparts in liberal democracies.\n\nA future in which everyone has access to a wide variety of AI assistants with a diverse collection of expertise, language ability, culture, value systems, political opinions, and interpretations of history is the future we want.\n\nThat future can *only* come about through open source AI platforms enabling a large diversity of fine-tuned systems.\n\nThis post was prompted by a tweet by Vinod Khosla against the open sourcing of frontier AI models, in response to an interview of Gary Tan (from Y Combinator) in favor of open source AI platforms. \nClearly, as a major investor in OpenAI, Vinod can profit financially from a closed approach to AI.\nBut I don't think that is his main reason for opposing open source frontier models.\nHe is genuinely worried about China getting its hands on it.\nThat worry is misguided.\nhttps://lnkd.in/eY-BcZ-F",

I will propose a modular cognitive architecture that may constitute a path towards answering these questions. The centerpiece of the architecture is a predictive world model that allows the system to predict the consequences of its actions and to plan a sequence of actions that optimize a set of objectives. The objectives include guardrails that guarantee the system's controllability and safety. The world model employs a Hierarchical Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (H-JEPA) trained with self-supervised learning. The JEPA learns abstract representations of the percepts that are simultaneously maximally informative and maximally predictable. \n\nWorking paper: https://lnkd.in/g-h6cqRy\nSlides: https://lnkd.in/eTq65_tF\nVideo: https://lnkd.in/efGkys4i",

    "content": "* Language is low bandwidth: less than 12 bytes/second. A person can read 270 words/minutes, or 4.5 words/second, which is 12 bytes/s (assuming 2 bytes per token and 0.75 words per token). A modern LLM is typically trained with 1x10^13 two-byte tokens, which is 2x10^13 bytes. This would take about 100,000 years for a person to read (at 12 hours a day).\n\n* Vision is much higher bandwidth: about 20MB/s. Each of the two optical nerves has 1 million nerve fibers, each carrying about 10 bytes per second. A 4 year-old child has been awake a total 16,000 hours, which translates into 1x10^15 bytes.\n\nIn other words:\n- The data bandwidth of visual perception is roughly 1.6 million times higher than the data bandwidth of written (or spoken) language.\n- In a mere 4 years, a child has seen 50 times more data than the biggest LLMs trained on all the text publicly available on the internet.\n\nThis tells us three things:\n1. Yes, text is redundant, and visual signals in the optical nerves are even more redundant (despite being 100x compressed versions of the photoreceptor outputs in the retina). But redundancy in data is *precisely* what we need for Self-Supervised Learning to capture the structure of the data. The more redundancy, the better for SSL.\n2. Most of human knowledge (and almost all of animal knowledge) comes from our sensory experience of the physical world. Language is the icing on the cake. We need the cake to support the icing.\n3. There is *absolutely no way in hell* we will ever reach human-level AI without getting machines to learn from high-bandwidth sensory inputs, such as vision.\n\nYes, humans can get smart without vision, even pretty smart without vision and audition. But not without touch. Touch is pretty high bandwidth, too.",

It must be sampled from a distribution or or varied over a set. It parameterizes the set (or distribution) of plausible predictions.\n\nThe trick is to train the entire thing from observation triplets (x(t),a(t),x(t+1)) while preventing the Encoder from collapsing to a trivial solution on which it ignores the input.\n\nAuto-regressive generative models (such as LLMs) are a simplified special case in which\n1. the Encoder is the identity function: h(t) = x(t),\n2. the state is a window of past inputs \n3. there is no action variable a(t)\n4. x(t) is discrete\n5. the Predictor computes a distribution over outcomes for x(t+1) and uses the latent z(t) to select one value from that distribution.\nThe equations reduce to:\ns(t) = [x(t),x(t-1),...x(t-k)]\nx(t+1) = Pred( s(t), z(t) )\nThere is no collapse issue in that case.",

    "content": "Modeling the world for action by generating pixel is as wasteful and doomed to failure as the largely-abandoned idea of \"analysis by synthesis\".\n\nDecades ago, there was a big debate in ML about the relative advantages of generative methods vs discriminative methods for classification.\nLearning theorists, such as Vapnik, argued against generative methods, pointing out that training a generative modeling was a way more difficult than classification (from the sample complexity standpoint).\n\nRegardless, a whole community in computer vision was arguing that recognition should work by generating pixels from explanatory latent variables. At inference time, one would infer the configuration of latent variables that generated the observed pixels.\nThe inference method would use optimization: e.g. use a 3D model of an object and try to find the pose parameters that reproduce the image.\nThis never quite worked, and it was very slow.\n\nLater, some people converted to the Bayesian religion and tried to use Bayesian inference for the latent (e.g. using variational approximations and/or sampling).\nAt some point, when Non-Parametric Bayes and Latent Dirichlet Allocation became the rage in text modeling, some folks heroically attempted to apply that to object recognition from images.\n>>> THIS WAS A COMPLETE AND UTTER FAILURE <<<\n\nIf your goal is to train a world model for recognition or planning, using pixel-level prediction is a terrible idea.\n\nGeneration happens to work for text because text is discrete with a finite number of symbols. Dealing with uncertainty in the prediction is easy in such settings. Dealing with prediction uncertainty in high-dimension continuous sensory inputs is simply intractable. \nThat's why generative models for sensory inputs are doomed to failure.",

Copyright law protects against unauthorized exact or near-exact copies of a painting, photo, movie, or other visual piece.\n2. When a person distributes a sufficiently similar copy of an art piece, it's a violation of copyright regardless of the tools and process used to produce it.\n3. The liable person is the person *distributing* the piece, not the artist, and not makers of the tools.\n4. Image generation systems are trained to generate images that are on the \"manifold\" of nice-looking images. Obviously, the training images are on this manifold.\n5. Hence, sufficiently detailed prompt will produce images that are substantially similar to images from the training set. It is not at all surprising that a prompt like \"The Batman movie, rooftop scene, screenshot, 4k...\" will produce an image very similar to an actual screenshot from the movie.\n6.

But the idea that somehow we're going to just scale up the techniques that we have and get to human-level AI? No. We're missing something big to get machines to learn efficiently, like humans and animals do. We don't know what it is yet.\n\n- SL: Why did Meta decide that Llama code would be shared with others, open source style?\nYLC: When you have an open platform that a lot of people can contribute to, progress becomes faster. The systems you end up with are more secure and perform better. Imagine a future in which all of our interactions with the digital world are mediated by an AI system. You do not want that AI system to be controlled by a small number of companies on the West Coast of the US. Maybe the Americans won't care, maybe the American government won't care. But I tell you right now, in Europe, they won't like it. They say, ‚ÄúOK, well, this speaks English correctly. But what about French? What about German? What about Hungarian? Or Dutch or whatever? What did you train it on? How does that reflect our culture?‚Äù\n\n- SL: Couldn‚Äôt someone take a sophisticated open source system that a big company releases, and use it to take over the world? [...]\nYLC: [...] It's the history of the world: Whenever technology progresses, you can't stop the bad guys from having access to it. Then it‚Äôs my good AI against your bad AI. The way to stay ahead is to progress faster. The way to progress faster is to open the research, so the larger community contributes to it.\n\n- SL: But if computers get superintelligent, why would they need us?\nYLC: There is no reason to believe that just because AI systems are intelligent they will want to dominate us. People are mistaken when they imagine that AI systems will have the same motivations as humans. They just won‚Äôt. We'll design them not to.",

It‚Äôs a faith in humanity ‚Äî and all sentient beings ‚Äî propelling ourselves forward into the infinite tomorrow.\"\n\nA few of my famous friends and colleagues have expressed hesitations about technological risks. It is not because they are techno-pessimists. They do believe in the ability of technological progress, and AI in particular, to improve human condition. But they doubt that current economic and political institutions, and humanity as a whole, will be capable of using it for good.\n\nI also like this bit:\n\"So anyone who thinks that technology is pushed forward solely by scrappy inventors in their garages, while government and big business merely parasitizes off of their labors, is deeply wrong. And anyone who thinks that technology is pushed forward solely by government planners, while the private sector merely parasitizes off of government‚Äôs efforts, is also deeply wrong.\"\n\nPeople often forget that most of the technologies that power the modern world were invented in publicly-funded university labs, or industry research labs of dominant companies, such as AT&T Bell Labs, IBM research, and Xerox PARC, even if many products derived from these inventions were later developed and deployed by smaller companies or garage-dwelling tinkerers.",

We had to use a handcrafted decoder, but managed to backpropagate gradients through it to perform end-to-end, sentence-level learning. Applying the idea to an entire page was completely out of the question with the hardware available in the early 1990s.\n\nBut nowadays, one can use Swin architectures (i.e. a ConvNet/transformer hybrid with local attention), and an LLM-style auto-regressive decoder to produce the character string on the output.\nThat's precisely what Lukas Blecher,  Guillem Cucurull,     Thomas Scialom, and Robert Stojnic did for this project.\n\nSuper impressive!\n\nWith source.

But they are just protecting their commercial interests.\nI argue that closeness is *considerably* more dangerous than openness.\n\nOnce LLMs become the main channel through which everyone accesses information, people (and governments) will *demand* that it be open and transparent. Basic infrastructure must be open.\n\n\"Dr. LeCun also pointed to recent history to explain why Meta was committed to open-sourcing A.I. technology. He said the evolution of the consumer internet was the result of open, communal standards that helped build the fastest, most widespread knowledge-sharing network the world had ever seen.\n‚ÄúProgress is faster when it is open,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou have a more vibrant ecosystem where everyone can contribute.\"\n\n\"In Battle Over A.I., Meta Decides to Give Away Its Crown Jewels.\" https://lnkd.in/eHuBcWmi",
